    "## Working with CSVs\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSV Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "CSVs are the simplest and the most commonly used data format. CSV stands for _Comma Separated Values_. CSVs contain rows of data where each line is _terminated_ by a newline character (`\\n`) and columns within a row are _delimited_ (or _separated_) by commas (`,`). You might be familiar with this format from working with Excel files. CSVs are commonly used by Excel to import/export data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that commas and newline characters are special characters; therefore if a field contains these characters, it needs to be wrapped by another special character called the _Enclosing Character_. This is typically set by double quotes (`\"`). For example to following line represents 3 fields: _name, home\\_town, genre_ where the address field is wrapped in quotes to include a comma:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "name,home_town,genre\n",
    "Biggie Smalls,\"Brooklyn, NY\",hip hop\n",
    "\"Queen Latifah\",\"Newark, NJ\",\"hip hop\"\n",
    "\"Salt-N-Pepa\",\"Queens, NY\",\"hip hop\"\n",
    "Tupac Shakur,\"Harlem, NY\".\"hip hop\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, to be safe, all string or text fields could be wrapped in quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another special character called the _Escape Character_; commonly set as backslash (`\\`). This character is used to escape the _Enclose_ character; allowing a text field to include a quote. Yes, we almost get into an endless cycle! If we need a single backslash in the text, we should enter double backslashes: '\\\\'. Take a look at the example below. This example contains a lyric field that includes both a quote and backslash:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "name,lyric\n",
    "Biggie Smalls, \"The song Juicy includes: \\\"Salt-n-Pepa \\\\ Heavy D up in the limousine\\\" -the end\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, you don't have to worry about these as much. Python automatically takes care of escaping or enclosing fields. Just know that there are these special characters which you can change:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name | Default Character |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Delimiter | `,` (comma) |\n",
    "| Line Terminator | `\\n` (enter or newline) |\n",
    "| Enclosing or Quoting | `\"` (double quote) |\n",
    "| Escape | `\\` (backslash) |\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to mention that there's another similar file type called TSV or _Tab Separated Values_ where fields are terminated by tabs (`\\t`).\n"
