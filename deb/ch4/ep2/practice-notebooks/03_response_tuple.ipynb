    "Flask is smart enough to interpret your route function `return` statement as proper HTTP response. Flask simply interprets the `return` value as text or JSON (seen later). But a proper HTTP response also includes an HTTP stats code and headers. Flask allows you to also set these values if your `return` statement returns a tuple. The tuple should include exactly three elements: _data, status\\_code, headers_.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = \"hello\"\n",
    "headers = {\"server-type\": \"python-flask\"}\n",
    "return data, 200, headers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay attention that our `return` statement returns a tuple of three elements. Here:\n",
    "- the HTTP body (or payload) is set simply to the text value of the `data` variable which is \"hello\"\n",
    "- the HTTP status code is set to `200` (the default OK status code)\n",
    "- the HTTP headers are always set as a dict. The dict keys/values correspond to the HTTP headers. In this example, we set the content of custom header called `server-type`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important thing to note is the type of `data` parameter. The two commonly used types are `str` or `dict`. Flask sends back string data as simple text payload. **But**, it's important to know that flask will send back dictionary data as JSON payload. This is **very** helpful. \n",
