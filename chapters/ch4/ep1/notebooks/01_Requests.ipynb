    "# APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will learn all about **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface or **API**s. They first question you probably wondering is:\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most basic sense, an API how an application talks to anything outside itself. We see it referenced in programming when we learn the methods of a library so that our application can interact with that library. That general definition covers a vast amount of uses cases but the most common type of API is a **HTTP** or a **REST** API. If you've ever browsed the web, you've used HTTP and REST is a very similar protocol so we can learn them together and henceforth, when we use API in the chapter, we're referring to an HTTP or REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does an API work? We can also think about our web browsing example to get an overall idea of how they work before jumping into the specific components. Let's say you want to look up direction in Google Maps. To navigate to a page, you give your browser an address or URL that looks something like `https://google.com/maps`. This address consists of three parts:\n",
    "- `https://` this is the protocol which describes the manner in which you're connecting. HTTPS is the secure form of HTTP but we can also see things like FTP here.\n",
    "- `google.com` is the domain or host. This is the root address we're trying to access. Your browser uses DNS to convert this to an IP address to access. In this chapter, we'll often directly use local IP addresses like `0.0.0.0` or the alias `localhost` but this component tells us who we're asking for information.\n",
    "- `/maps` tells us the path or endpoint we want to access. This tells Google what of their many services we're trying to access. `/maps` is a very broad endpoint that has a lot of functionality but we will be accessing and creating much more focused endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at another example to learn a few more components: `localhost:5050/fruit?color=red`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this URL doesn't specify a protocol, so the default of resource we're contacting is expected. We have our host `localhost` and endpoint `/fruit` but we also have two new components:\n",
    "- `:5050` this specifies the port we will communicate on. Different services talk on different ports by default, for example HTTP uses port 80 and HTTPS uses 443. We're choosing to talk on port 5050.\n",
    "- `?color=red` this is a query parameter where we supply specific arguments to our API. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic components to a URL but how do they actually get used to access an API? To access an API we use the URL to make a **Request**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Request\n",
    "\n",
    "An API interaction always starts by a client (your code or browser) sending a **Request** to a remote service on a server (google, spotify, etc..). A _Request_ combines a URL with a HTTP or REST **method**. The _method_ tells the server about the type of interaction that we're going to make. There are two main methods we will use for almost all our API interactions **GET** and **POST**. As the name suggests, _GET_ corresponds to getting data from the server versus _POST_ is for posting data the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GET\n",
    "\n",
    "A GET request is the basic request for data from an endpoint. It is the default request made when you enter a URL into a browser. A GET request should the server side data, just request to be sent that data. If we want to send something _to_ an API, we use the POST method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### POST\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time you've filled out a form in a browser and clicked \\*submit\\* you've probably made a POST request. They have all the same parts as a GET request but with an additional request **body** containing the data we're POSTing. The API receives the information from the URL so it knows where and what do do with the the data it gets in the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Others\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [7 other HTTP methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) such as _HEAD_ which is like a GET but they actual data isn't sent back, just the headers are (more on them soon!). In this tutorial, we will focus on the main two methods but it is important to know of the others so they can be used in the corner cases they cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "We just heard about headers in the context of what we get back from a request but what are they? **Headers** are a way for package additional information or _metadata_ into a _Request_ or the _Response_ we get back. Headers are a set of key/value pairs just like a dictionary. They consist of a name, followed by a `:` and then the value associated with that name. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we make POST request, we might want to tell the API what format of data we're sending. To do this we'd use the `Content-Type` header to do this. If we're sending an png image, we'd include the header `Content-Type: image/png` or if we were sending JSON we would include `Content-Type: application/json`. Headers are not case sensitive but [they follow standard conventions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) so that there is commonality across the internet and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Headers example:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"Content-Type\": \"image/png\",\n",
    "    \"Authentication\": \"Bearer <%authentication-key%>\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Response\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we make a Request, whatever we get back from the server is our Response! These contain three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Status code** this [standardized number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) lets us know if our request worked or not, along with some information into why it worked or failed. For example, if you've ever gotten the **404** error when you make a typo in your browser address bar, you've seen a status code. The leading 4 tells us this is a client error (you made the mistake in typing) and the 04 means 'resource not found'. So this status tells us the browser couldn't find what we were looking for. Similarly, if we see a status code starting with 5, we know the error happened on the server side. This could still be our fault if we provided bad information to the server but at least we know it was received and the \n",
    "- **Headers** are exactly the same as our Request headers and carry additional information about the Response.\n",
    "- **Body**: just like we could send a message body in our POST method, the Response method gives us data in its body. This can be a simple as a 'Hello' string or as complex as a huge chunk of bytes making up an image or a giant JSON string. \n",
    "\n",
    "And those are the basic parts that make up API Requests and Responses! As you can probably guess by their power and flexibility, there is a lot of additional nuance and detail but these basic pieces are sufficient to get us started and there are [amazing resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) if you want to go deeper on any aspect. With all these basic pieces explained, let's take a look at how we actually *make* a Request using these pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Postman Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "One great tool for working with APIs is **Postman**. This tool is designed specifically to make requests which means is is prefect for both learning about requests and in the future, testing your API without having to make a full Python script. To get started with Postman, you will need to [make an account](https://www.postman.com/postman-account/) and either [download the program](https://www.postman.com/downloads/post) or use their web version.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## GET from Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an account, launch Postman and sign in. We're going to be making a GET request to the English Wikipedia API so first, let's navigate Postman to our request making screen. From the home screen, click **Start with something new**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt=\"screenshot of the postman home screen\"](../imgs/new.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then from the popup, select **HTTP Request**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt=\"screenshot of the popup including the HTTP request option we will be clicking\"](../imgs/new-request.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open a tab with a nice empty form ready to make a GET request:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt=\"screenshot of the default Postman request screen\"](../imgs/blank-request.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our form for making our request, let's learn a little about the Wikipedia API we're about to GET from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wiki API\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can make a request we need to know two main things:\n",
    "- What endpoint are using for our request?\n",
    "- What parameters do we need to get what we want?\n",
    "\n",
    "From [the Wikipedia documentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page#Quick_Start) we see that the English language Wikipedia endpoint is `https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php`. We enter this as the url following the GET in Postman:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt=\"the same screenshot of the request form with the wikipedia endpoint as the url\"](../imgs/wiki1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basic setup that will allow us to make requests from Wikipedia. Next we need to decide _what_ we're going to request. In our basic `localhost:5050/fruits?color=red` example, we were supplying the parameter `color` with value `red`. We need to learn what parameters Wikipedia is expecting and what values we can provide. Let's start with learning how to search Wikipedia as [documented here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Search). We note that the first thing we need to specify is the `action` parameters. Searching is a type of `query` so we add the following to our **Params** section:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt=\"the same screenshot of the request form with the action param set to query\"](../imgs/wiki2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Within `query`, we see that [the parameter `list` tells us what to get and full text search is specified with the value `search](https://www.mediawiki.org/w/api.php?action=help&modules=query). While we're here,we will also specify the format of the response we want to receive as JSON with the `format` parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt=\"the same screenshot of the request form with the list and format parameters set\"](../imgs/wiki3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With these top level params set, we can now actually perform our search. Let's set two search parameters, `srsearch` and `srlimit`. The first specifies the search string to use. Let's say we're amateur botanists and want to learn about oak trees. We can do this by setting `srsearch` to `'oak trees'`. Next, use use `srlimit` to limit our search to the top 5 responses so we aren't overwhelmed with trees. Our request form will now look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt=\"the same screenshot of the request form with the srsearch and srlimit set\"](../imgs/wiki4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this completed, we're ready to **Send** our request by clicking the button in the upper right corner. We will see Wikipedia's response to our request below our form:\n",
